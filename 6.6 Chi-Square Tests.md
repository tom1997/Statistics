## 6.6 Chi-Square Tests

In the section we introduce tests of statistical hypotheses called chi-square  tests.A test of this sort was originally proposed by Karl Pearson in 1900, and it provided one of the earlier method of statistical inference.

Let the random variable X_i be N(\mu, \sigma^2), i=1,2......,n, and let X_1,X_2,...,X_n be mutually independent. Thus the joint p.d.f. of these variables is

\frac1{\sigma_1\sigma_2...\sigma_n(2\pi)^\frac{n}{2}}{exp[{-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{1}^n(\frac{x_i-\mu_i}{\sigma_i})^2  ]} },\qquad -\infty<x<\infty

The random variable that is difined by the exponent (apart from the coefficient -\frac{1}{2}) is \Large\sum_1^n(\frac{X_i-\mu_i}{\sigma_i})

and this random variable is \chi^2(n).
